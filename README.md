Ace (Ajax.org Cloud9 Editor)
============================

**Note**: this is a version of Ace stripped down to the bare minimum needed to edit C-like **p44script** code.
It was created from the ace prebuilt [src-noconflict](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace-builds/tree/master/src-noconflict)
and [src-min-noconflict](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace-builds/tree/master/src-min-noconflict) repositories,
removing everything not strictly needed (themes, plugins, languages, snippets) for constrained flash space reasons.

The full version of ace can be found at [https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace).
